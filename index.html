      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Happiness is one of the most fundamental aspects of human experience, yet it remains an overlooked metric in many discussions about success, well-being, and progress. As I reflect on its importance, it strikes me that happiness should be considered just as essential, if not more, than economic or academic achievements when evaluating the quality of life. In a world where metrics like GDP, productivity, and test scores dominate our conversations, it's surprising how little attention we give to the emotional and psychological well-being of individuals. Happiness is not just a fleeting emotion but a vital indicator of how fulfilled we feel in our personal lives and within society. It has the power to drive motivation and inspire creativity, yet it is too often sidelined in favor of more easily quantifiable outcomes. This imbalance is something I believe needs to be addressed. Happiness should be at the core of how we measure success and well-beingâ€”not just as a bonus, but as a priority. I have made it my final project to explore possible metrics of measuring such an abstract concept through the lens of a simple student. Some topics to be discussed include marriage rate, average income, and education rate. (DISCLAIMER: All proceeding mentions of the whole population is in reference to Ward 24's population)</p>

      <h2>Findings</h2>
      <h3>Marriage</h3>
      <p>   An analysis of the data showing that 21,135 out of 50,360 people are currently married reveals several insights. The ratio of married to non-married people is 21,135:50,360, which roughly translates to 41.95%. With 42% of individual people living in private households, we can see that over half (58%), are not currently in a married status. This has been an ongoing trend in Canada. During 2020, a total of 98,355 marriages were registered in Canada. This number is even lower than the same statistic during 1938. Taking into account the fact that the population was around 11 million back then and that we've significantly grown since then, it is very concerning to even come close to marital rates from back then. Perhaps this is the greatest indicator of unhappiness in ward 24. While it is important to still consider the temporary impacts of COVID-19, I believe the more lasting impacts of the pandemic shows itself in how unhappiness has rooted itself into our culture.</p>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>Analyzing the fact that 16,620 out of 50360 people have a bachelor's degree or higher reveals some valuable insights. This trend is consistent with previous reports by StatCan; in 2006, roughly 23% of the population aged between 25 and 64 had a bachelor's degree or higher, in 2021 this ratio reached 32.9%. According to the current census data, 32.2% of ward 24 has attained such education in 2021. One element to consider when it comes to the growingly educated population is the fact that people will end up working jobs while being overqualified. I believe this to cause a negative impact on a person's psyche, as people become exposed to the notion that they wasted their time getting a degree. Let me ask, are people more or less satisfied by getting a degree? I believe that in general, people who have their degrees are more inclined to be happy rather than people without. However, I believe that career success is a much lesser contributor to general happiness when compared to marriage or partnership. To conclude, this statistic points to the majority of the population being less inclined to be happy as they do not have a degree, however, it is important to weigh this metric lower than others.</p>
      <h3>Income</h3>
      <p>The population has an average income of 59900 with a median of 48000. Looking into these nunmbers can provide some interesting results. Most notably, the wealth distribution is right-skewed. Assuming that the wealth is normally distributed, the previous finding indicates that the vast majority of people makes much less than the median lets on. In other words, the average differing this much from the median is a clear sign of outliers skewing the average to seem more inclusive of a larger income. Keeping this in mind, we will move forward with the analysis with the median, not the average. Using the Canada immigration cost guide as a reference, we will calculate just how much money is left over after expenses in Canada. Assumming you only pay for one room, it will cost at least $350 a month, which adds up to $4200 per year. A lowball estimate for food expenses is $300 per month if you spend $10 a day, which is $3,600 a year. Using my own car insurance as a high estimate due to my age, I believe $1500 a year for car insurance to be a good estimate. Heating and other utility bills had an average of $300 per month in 2023, which is $3,600 a year. This leaves us with roughly $25,000 to spend over the year. Assuming you add a fourth of it to your savings, that's $18,750 left to spend. Every month, the average person would only be able to spend about $1,500 assuming they live by themselves, own one car, has no other expenses, and already owns a car. This financial stress can really impact a person's view on the future, after all, in order to just raise a child one would either need to cut off all personal expenses or both parents would need to be working. Although it should be noted that this is quite a common situation to be in, I believe that financial pressure is a common headache among adults.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In conclusion, measuring happiness through the lenses of marriage, income, and education provides valuable insights into the factors that influence one's mental health. While marriage often fosters emotional support and stability, it seems that we are actively straying further away from it. Income contributes to a sense of security and access to opportunities but it seems like the average person in ward 24 does not have all too much financial freedom. Education, in turn, empowers individuals with knowledge and skills, promoting personal growth and sense of contribution, however, it is important to remember those who were not given the same priveleges as we were. These metrics should be interpreted holistically, recognizing that happiness is subjective and influenced by a myriad of interconnected variables. By incorporating these statistical indicators with a more qualitative approach, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of happiness and craft policies that prioritize the well-being of individuals and communities.</p>
